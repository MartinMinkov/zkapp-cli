# Mina zkApp CLI

The Mina zkApp CLI allows you to scaffold, write, test, & deploy zkApps
("zero-knowledge apps") for [Mina Protocol](https://minaprotocol.com/) using
recommended best practices. Apps are written using
[SnarkyJS](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference), a
TypeScript framework for writing zero-knowledge proof-based smart contracts,
which is included by default in projects created using this CLI.

## Get started

To get started, please read this README, followed by [Mina Protocol's zkApp
docs](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps) for a step-by-step guide.

## Dependencies

You'll need the following installed to use the zkApp CLI:

- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `--experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+
- Git 2+

If you have an older version installed, we suggest installing a newer version
using the package manager for your system: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac),
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (Windows), or apt/yum/etc (Linux). On
Linux, you may need to install a recent NodeJS version via NodeSource
([deb](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall) or
[rpm](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall)), as recommended
by the NodeJS Project.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

## Usage

```sh
zk --help
```

### Create a new project

```sh
zk project my-proj  # or path/to/my-proj

✔ Fetch project template
✔ Initialize Git repo
✔ NPM install
✔ Set project name
✔ Git init commit

Success!

Next steps:
  cd my-proj
  git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
  git push -u origin main
```

This command creates a directory containing a new project template, fully set up
& ready for local development.

- See the included [README](templates/project/README.md) for usage instructions.
  All usual commands will be available: `npm run build`, `npm run test`,
  `npm run coverage`, etc.
- A Git repo will be initialized in the project directory automatically. For
  consistency, we use `main` as the default Git branch, by convention.
- A [Github Actions CI workflow](templates/project/.github/workflows/ci.yml) is
  also included. If you push your project to Github, Github Actions will run
  your tests (named as `*.test.js`) automatically, whenever you push a commit or
  open a pull request.
- Code style consistency (via Prettier) and linting (via ES Lint) are
  automatically enforced using Git pre-commit hooks. This requires no
  configuration and occurs automatically when you commit to Git--e.g. `git commit -m 'feat: add awesome feature'`.
- To skip all checks in the Git pre-commit hook (not recommended), you can pass
  the `-n` flag to Git--e.g. `git commit -m 'a bad commit' -n`. But we'd
  recommend avoiding this and resolving any errors which exist in your project
  until the pre-commit hook passes.

### Create an example project

```sh
zk example <name>
```

Where `name` is one of the names found in the [example directory](examples).

All examples are based on the standard project template created by the
zkApp CLI, and only contain changes within the `src` directory, so feel free to use
one of these as your project base.

When inside an example folder in your terminal, you can run the example using
the following command:

```sh
npm run build && node ./build/src/index.js
```

### Create a new file

```sh
zk file <name>  # or path/to/name
```

This will create `name.js` and `name.test.js`.

For convenience, running this command in your project's _root_ directory will
create the files inside your project's `src` dir automatically, even if you
don't specify `src/` as part of your file path. When _not_ in your project's
root dir, files will be created at the path you specify relative to your
terminal's current working directory.

### Show system info

```sh
zk system
```

This will output system info such as your NodeJS version, NPM version,
`zkapp-cli` version, etc. Please include this if submitting a bug report for
`zkapp-cli`, for easier troubleshooting.
